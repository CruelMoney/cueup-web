                                    We may, either directly or through Third-Parties we engage to
                                    provide services to us, review, scan, or analyze your
                                    communications with other users exchanged via the Platform for
                                    fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance,
                                    investigation, product development, research and customer
                                    support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention
                                    efforts, the Platform may scan and analyze messages and
                                    attachments to mask contact information and references to other
                                    websites. This helps to prevent fraudulent actors from asking
                                    Organizers to send them money outside of the Platform, such as
                                    by bank transfer or other money transfer methods. We may also
                                    scan, review or analyze messages for research and product
                                    development purposes to help make search, booking and user
                                    communications more efficient and effective, as well as to
                                    debug, improve and expand product offerings. We will not review,
                                    scan, or analyze your communications for sending Third-Party
                                    marketing messages to you. We will also not sell these reviews
                                    or analyses of communications to Third Parties. We will also use
                                    automated methods to carry out these reviews or analyses where
                                    reasonably possible. However, from time to time we may have to
                                    manually review some communications. By using the Platform, you
                                    consent that Cueup, in its sole discretion, may, either directly

                            For example, a cookie could allow the Platform to recognize your
