                                    The Service Fees payable will be displayed to an Organizer
                                    before the Organizer confirms a Booking request to a DJ. Upon
                                    receipt of your Booking request, Stripe may initiate a
                                    pre-authorization and/or charge a nominal amount to your Payment
                                    Method pursuant to the Payments Terms. If a confirmed Booking is
                                    cancelled (i.e. by the applicable DJ), any amounts collected by
                                    Stripe will be refunded to such Organizer, depending on the
                                    selections the Organizer makes via the Site and Application, and
                                    any pre-authorization of such Organizer's Payment Method will be
                                    released, if applicable.

                                    with your Cueup Account. Stripe will collect the Total Fees

                                    platform, Cueup charges Fees. Stripe collects these Fees
                                    pursuant to the Payments Terms, and, where applicable, may also
                                    collect Taxes (such as VAT in Europe) in respect of the Fees.
                                    Cueup deducts the Fees from the DJ Price before remitting the

                            Cueup’s online platform facilitates Bookings between Organisers and DJs
                            who may pay in a currency different from their own currency, which may
                            require currency conversions to accommodate these differing currency
                            preferences. Although the Cueup platform allows users to view the price
                            of Offers in a number of currencies, the currencies available for users
                            to make and receive payments may be limited, and may not include the
                            default currency in any given geographic location.

                            If you reside in the United States, you and Cueup agree that any
                            dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms
                            or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity

                            or Collective Content (collectively, “<strong>Disputes</strong>“) will
                            be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the
                            right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
                            competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
                            misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
                            secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge
                            and agree that you and Cueup are each waiving the right to a trial by
                            jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
                            class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general
                            action, or any other representative proceeding. Further, unless both you
                            and Cueup otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate
                            more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
                            form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific
                            paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute

                            preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any

                            arbitrate evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the
                            Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of
                            this provision. The arbitration will be administered by the American
                            Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>“) in accordance with the
                            Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>“) then in

                            <em>Arbitration Process</em>. A party who desires to initiate
                            arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for
                            Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a{' '}

                            to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the
                            parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the
                            parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of
                            delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the

                            <em>Arbitration Location and Procedure</em>. Unless you and Cueup
                            otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where
                            you reside. If your claim does not exceed <span>$</span>10,000, then the
                            arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and
                            Cueup submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
                            arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds{' '}
                            <span>$</span>10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the
                            AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the
                            discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
                            parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

                            decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which
                            the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be
                            entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award
                            damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of
                            Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for
                            which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory
                            or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the
                            extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s
                            individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to
                            an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under
                            applicable law. Cueup will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may

                            However, if your claim for damages does not exceed <span>$</span>75,000,
                            Cueup will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the

                            The failure of Cueup to enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                            will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or
